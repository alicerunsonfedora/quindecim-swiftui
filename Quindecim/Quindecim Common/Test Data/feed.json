            "rendered": "\n<p>As of publication,&nbsp; Goucher President Kent Devereaux has attended two large informational sessions related to staff layoffs and Gardaworld. First, he attended the weekly GSG meeting November 12, as previously planned. (My <a href=\"http:\/\/quinnews.com\/staffing-cuts-across-college\">previous article<\/a>, posted online, incorporated information from that meeting, as well as communications with the entire student body up until that point.) He indicated that he would continue to communicate with the student body as we all learn more about the situation. GSG asked Kent to have one of these public forums during the November 20 Common Hour, which Kent requested to do in the Orange Room of Mary Fisher. The conversation focused primarily on Gardaworld and the Administrative Services Review, with layoffs in the Academic Center for Excellence (ACE) dominating the session. There was a brief conversation about the Green Fund and campus sustainability, as well.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are three main interrelated issues at play within this week of tension and uncertainty on campus: Campus Safety, changes to the Student Code of Conduct, and layoffs from the Administrative Services Review. These issues fall into a wider conversation about shared governance that is taking place across campus.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yuchen Ding \u201822 remarked that the recent GSG ballot contained a referendum about Gardaworld. Ding quoted: \u201cA \u2018yes\u2019 vote means you reject the decision to acquire the services of Gardaworld. A \u2018no\u2019 vote means you do not reject the decision to acquire the services of Gardaworld.\u201d With a record-breaking 43% voter turnout, 88% of the student body who voted in this election voted \u2018yes\u2019 on the referendum.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When asked about the move to a privatized security force on campus, Kent said: \u201cthe decision to move to an outsource model for public safety and move it under the VP of Campus Operations long-term is a decision that we\u2019re not gonna go back on. There are so many issues around the way we are currently doing public safety that, quite frankly, are invisible to you all but quite frankly, are an extreme risk to the school. No, I cannot elaborate on confidential issues that really are. We need to make some changes. Suffice it to say we have some really, really stellar people in Public Safety, and we\u2019re hoping that they\u2019re gonna move over to Gardaworld. We have so many other issues that really have to do with consistency in terms of security and in terms of not being respectful to our community. There are people who we just have across the board, across the board, lack of accountability. We have people doing a good job in Public Safety and then it goes both ways, and we have some of our staff and faculty, who are treating officers, who are <em>our <\/em>employees, in a really disrespectful manner, so it was problematic across the board.\u201d Kent also noted departure of Director of Public Safety Dave Heffer last month let a leadership gap within GCOPS. Kent stated that \u201cwe started to explore the outsourcing model, which has pretty much become predominant in higher education\u201d in response to this leadership gap. A student pointed out that several students have called almost 30 peer institutions across the country, and not a single one of them outsources their Public Safety office. It is important to note that the peer institutions are those identified by Goucher itself.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kent acknowledged that Gardaworld has acquired \u201csketchy\u201d companies such as Aegis. \u201cThe big picture is: over the long term, they are the right company for us.\u201d After looking at three companies and Maryland, Kent noted that \u201cFrom everything we\u2019ve read since [learning of the issues with Gardaworld subsidiaries, particularly Aegis and being impressed with Gardaworld\u2019s response]&#8230;The larger picture is, over the long term, they are the right company with us to be outsourcing. Of all the companies we looked at, and we did three here in Maryland&#8230;they [Whelan] were far and away the best, because, number one, we are talking about <em>our<\/em> policies, they don\u2019t bring in their policies. It\u2019s our policies, our faculty, our staff, our students, define our policies&#8230;They then have to implement our policies.\u201d Kent also highlighted major differences between this situation and that of Johns Hopkins\u2019 private police force.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This policy is our campus\u2019s Student Code of Conduct. Part of an ongoing review of the College\u2019s 111 policies broadly overseen by College General Counsel Barbara Stob, this particular policy is being managed by the Associate Dean of Students for Student Support and Success, Nicole Johnson. Kent indicated that there are \u201cno formal policy changes yet. Will reach out to GSG&#8230;We define what our student code of conduct will be with student input.\u201d Johnson was not at the GSG meeting or the Common Hour.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two finalists for the new Director of Campus Safety position were recently on campus. Students were involved in the interview process for both of them. This position will be employed by Gardaworld.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When asked \u201cShould we be doing this at all?\u201d Kent responded: \u201cWe don\u2019t have the capabilities. It was the best things for our students going forward.\u201d Kent also indicated that the annual contract may not be practical in the future, speculating that \u201cwe may change our mind in two years.\u201d<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As <em>The Baltimore Sun<\/em> recently reported, there have been 13 staff layoffs as part of the Administrative Services Review. As Kent explained in the Common Hour Q&amp;A on November 20 in the orange room of Mary Fisher, rpk Group made their recommendations relating to the Administrative Services Review, and about half of them were implemented at the College by the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.goucher.edu\/explore\/leadership-and-vision\/presidents-cabinet\">President&#8217;s Cabinet<\/a>, which consists of the President, Vice Presidents, and General Counsel of Goucher. Kent indicated that two Trustees were involved in the process; the extent of this involvement remains unclear.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reason for the confidentiality, Kent has explained at both the November 20 meeting and the November 12 packed GSG meeting in Batza, was to reduce the possibility of internal leaks that would lead to rumors of people being on the chopping block. A main concern with this approach, which has been articulated to value efficiency and accuracy, is that it left everyone in the dark about the changes until they happened. While Kent has been explicit that these staff layoffs are a \u201cone and done\u201d occurrence meant to continue the faculty cuts that took place two years ago, there is a looming feeling of uncertainty and fear on campus right now.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most well-known staff layoffs that took place last week were in the Academic Center for Excellence. Better known as ACE, the office is considered a warm and trusted space on campus where generations of students have received academic coaching and emotional support. A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.change.org\/p\/goucher-board-save-ace\">change.org petition<\/a> created by Emily Belkowitz \u201821 entitled \u201cSave ACE\u201d has over 1,970 signatures as of publication time. In an update to the petition posted on November 17, Belkowitz writes in part:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe goal of this petition is to stop the restructuring of ACE. We also demand that Kay Beard and Peejo Sehr are reinstated to the old positions or are given new positions of equal or better value. It is unbelievable that the administration has decided that Kay and Peejo\u2019s jobs are not valuable to the school. We, the students, faculty, staff, family members, and alumni who have signed this petition wholeheartedly disagree with Goucher\u2019s decision to terminate their substantial roles. Kay and Peejo are the heart of Goucher. Goucher\u2019s mission is to promote student\u2019s success, and that cannot be done without Kay Beard and Peejo Sehr.\u201d<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kent has made it clear that ACE will be combining with what will be called the Office of Academic Advising and Support, with one current pre-major advisor training to be a coach, two others focusing on other responsibilities, with one director overseeing the office. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that\u2019s all it\u2019s ever going to be,\u201d noted Kent, indicating that the staff may grow in coming fiscal years. It remains uncertain whether Beard or Sehr have interest in returning to Goucher in the new director position.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The Quindecim<\/em> will continue to post updates in these stories as they evolve.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note:<\/em> this article has been lightly revised for precision and clarity.<br><\/p>\n",

As part of the course, we spent a lot of time discerning and reflecting on our values on both individual and group levels. With this, we also grappled with philosophical and qualitative differences between making decisions out of fear and not out of fear. I\u2019ve been thinking about how fear-based decision-making shows up in every aspect of my life, and I\u2019ve started dialing in more intentionally to recognizing environments of fear and insecurity.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This past week couple weeks have been intense. While layoffs and reorganizations are conceptually very normalized in the nonprofit world, this round of layoffs feels qualitatively different than the faculty cuts that happened two years ago, when I was new to campus.&nbsp; Uncertainty is alive and well on our campus.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My four years on campus are projected to be the same as the duration of the Trump presidency.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Within this context of despair at the impending loss of social programs, increased military spending, and devaluation of truth, I enrolled at Goucher. I knew that this would be a formative several years in our College\u2019s history, and I was ready to experience it all.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since I unpacked into my second-floor double in Winslow in the fall of 2017, I\u2019ve seen Tuttle get moved and repaired; I\u2019ve watched Fireside and Trustees get built; I\u2019ve switched from eating in Stimson to the renovated Mary Fisher; I\u2019ve watched the North side of campus become largely forgotten in an ambience of asbestos and the Stimson Stench. My year was the first of the Goucher Commons curriculum, which saw the rollout of DegreeWorks, Starfish (now Navigate), CPEs, and Race, Power, and Perspective requirements.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The prevailing student discourse during my first semester on campus centered around the question: \u201cDoes Goucher have an identity?\u201d Most upperclassmen I knew didn\u2019t seem to think so. I\u2019ve been on campus for program prioritization, countless reorganizations, budget shortfalls, advocacy around transparency, and a growing urgency surrounding the climate crisis.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>My first semester without construction on campus has been this one.&nbsp;<\/strong><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Philosophically, Jos\u00e9 was hired to stir the pot. The Ath was built and our dorm infrastructure was crumbling. Our academics were unfocused and he threw ideas at the campus to see what stuck. Jos\u00e9 was on the receiving end of a lot of student ire, and I imagine Kent will feel some of that as well.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As students, we have a responsibility to one another to keep track of the changes that are happening. It is our duty to collaborate amongst our peers to organize our questions and our feelings in ways that build relationships and trust.<strong> It is also not our job to do this alone.<\/strong> As members of a campus that is beginning to have an ongoing and enthusiastic \u201cyes!\u201d to the question \u201cDoes Goucher have an identity?\u201d, we need our faculty and staff to trust our intentions and to value our voices in tangible ways. <em>This is what a vision of shared governance can look like.<\/em> Through involving more in-house experts who are physically experiencing the tumult on campus, as well as communicating clearly with our community members off campus, we can work collaboratively to build a Goucher that lives and breathes its Community Principles. The stakes are high, and with the future of crises like the ones at the Southern border looming over us, we would do well to value each other as humans and build intergenerational relationships that will bring us closer as a cohesive community.<br><\/p>\n",

Set to the gentle, calming tinkles on a piano, we see the grainy film images of the red house, then the street, then the yellow blinking streetlight, then the door, and out the door comes&#8230;Mr. Rogers. Yes, he&#8217;s being played by another person\u2013\u2013a different icon of American kindness\u2013\u2013but somehow we know it&#8217;s HIM. It&#8217;s not just the mannerisms\u2013\u2013the zipper that goes all the way up and then comes down a little, the bit with the shoe\u2013\u2013but something more fundamental.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not just Tom Hanks that has the tenor of the man down; it feels as though all of <em>A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood<\/em> exists on the wavelength of Fred Rogers\u2019 quiet heroism. It&#8217;s patient, calm, honest, and open. It&#8217;s tempting to describe these qualities as &#8220;saintly,&#8221; but, as we&#8217;re told, Mr. Rogers doesn&#8217;t like that word. It puts him on a level of unattainability, and that won&#8217;t do. We all have it within ourselves to be Mr. Rogers. We&#8217;re all human.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s the hard lesson Lloyd Vogel learns over the course of the movie, because this isn&#8217;t actually a story about Mr. Rogers. Rather, it&#8217;s about just one of the many, many people he saved. &#8220;Someone has hurt Lloyd,&#8221; Mr. Rogers tells us in the beginning, and we see that hurt has transformed him into a cynical man; not a monster, or an unrealistically cruel person, but a man who perhaps understandably scoffs at the idea that Fred Rogers and &#8220;Mr. Rogers&#8221; are actually one and the same.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But they are. They are, and soon Lloyd finds himself on the receiving end of Mr. Rogers pure, unfiltered empathy, and it&#8217;s almost too much for him to take. There&#8217;s some potential tension towards the beginning, especially in the early interview scenes, where Vogel&#8217;s hard-hitting interview style clashes with Rogers&#8217; almost infuriating kindness. Matthew Rhys plays this tricky role with extraordinary precision, hitting all the right notes to ensure that we sympathize with him and long for his salvation (well, I say &#8220;extraordinary,&#8221; though anyone familiar with his stellar work on The Americans knew long ago just what he was capable of).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It sounds strange to say, considering that he&#8217;s widely considered to be one of the all-time great American actors, but Tom Hanks isn&#8217;t the man I would immediately think of when asked who should play Mr. Rogers. He&#8217;s very much of a type, and while it&#8217;s reductive to say that &#8220;he always plays Tom Hanks&#8221; &#8211; he doesn&#8217;t &#8211; it&#8217;s true that he does have a persona that usually shines through no matter what he&#8217;s doing.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What Marielle Heller manages to do is channel Hanks&#8217; inner goodness into a performance that evokes Fred Rogers more than it tries to imitate him. Heller, fresh off of another quietly affecting biopic (Can You Ever Forgive Me?) is directs the thing with clipped restraint, content to mostly stay out of the story&#8217;s way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;You love broken people,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Like me.&#8221; You might remember that line from the trailer. What&#8217;s not included is Mr. Rogers&#8217; response: &#8220;I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re broken.&#8221; What follows is the definitive scene of the movie, where Mr. Rogers asks Lloyd to join him in thinking about the people who loved him into who he is today. Lloyd agrees, and the restaurant where they&#8217;re eating goes quiet. And as the camera slowly zooms in on Tom Hanks&#8217; face, we realize that the movie is inviting us to do the same. So we stop. And we think.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"http:\/\/quinnews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Screen_Shot_2019_11_14_at_8.21.08_PM.0.png-1024x682.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2573\" srcset=\"http:\/\/quinnews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Screen_Shot_2019_11_14_at_8.21.08_PM.0.png-1024x682.jpeg 1024w, http:\/\/quinnews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Screen_Shot_2019_11_14_at_8.21.08_PM.0.png-300x200.jpeg 300w, http:\/\/quinnews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Screen_Shot_2019_11_14_at_8.21.08_PM.0.png-768x512.jpeg 768w, http:\/\/quinnews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Screen_Shot_2019_11_14_at_8.21.08_PM.0.png-480x320.jpeg 480w, http:\/\/quinnews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Screen_Shot_2019_11_14_at_8.21.08_PM.0.png-750x500.jpeg 750w, http:\/\/quinnews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Screen_Shot_2019_11_14_at_8.21.08_PM.0.png.jpeg 1820w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n",

            "rendered": "\n<p>&#8220;James Bond does not drive a Ford.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s because he&#8217;s a degenerate.&#8221;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This just feels like a throwback, doesn&#8217;t it? There&#8217;s something about Ford v Ferrari that evokes the days of cinema gone by, even though its closest analog I can think of is Ron Howard&#8217;s criminally underseen masterstroke, Rush (there&#8217;s also Le Mans, a 1971 Steve McQueen picture, but I&#8217;ve not seen it). It is, for better or worse, and old-school racing picture about companies trying to one-up each other and cars that go really, really fast.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The film begins as such, with the Ford Motor Company being out-maneuvered by Enzo Ferrari. So incensed by this humiliation is Henry Ford II that he becomes obsessed with defeating Ferrari at Le Mans, the most prestigious &#8211; and dangerous &#8211; race in the world. To do so, he conscripts the only American to ever win Le Mans: Carroll Shelby, a cowboy hat wearing Matt Damon, who was once on top of the world, but had to retire from racing due to a heart condition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A question might already have occurred to you; how in the world does Ford v Ferrari position Ford, which was one of the most powerful companies even back then, as the underdog? Quite simply, it doesn&#8217;t take their side. We&#8217;re with Ford only so far as we&#8217;re with Matt Damon, and he&#8217;s not always treated very well by them. For instance, he wants Christian Bale&#8217;s volatile Ken Miles to be the one to drive in Le Mans. Problem is, his hostile reputation puts him at odds with what the higher-up want a &#8220;Ford driver&#8221; to look like.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s only the beginning of Ford&#8217;s attempts to micromanage Damon (after, of course, promising him complete freedom to conduct himself however he wants). On the one hand, bravo to Ford v Ferrari for being very clear-eyed about how shamelessly and soullessly a big corporation would work to remorselessly screw over a group of people who are trying, for all intents and purposes, to give them the biggest win of their lives.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, this is a long, long movie, and a lot of it is a little meandering. A lot of the non-racing running time is committed to making the same point over and over again about how big companies are not Matt Damon&#8217;s friend, but he just can&#8217;t see it. James Mangold began his career with character-driven films like Cop Land and 3:10 to Yuma, and went on to make Logan, arguably the most character-driven superhero movie ever made. Here, there&#8217;s an element of that that&#8217;s missing. In something like Rush, the emotional core is the relationship is the constantly evolving rivalry between Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Br\u00fchl. Here, the Bale\/Damon dynamic never really gets close to that level, nor does any other relationship, for that matter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This would be more palatable, I think, if the script were just a bit better. Right at the beginning, we see a bunch of German investors who are interested in investing in Damon and Bale. They&#8217;re told, however, that Bale is &#8220;difficult.&#8221; One won race later, and the lead German investor has a moment to helpfully inform us that, &#8220;He&#8217;s difficult&#8230;but good.&#8221; Thanks, I needed that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s not the last of the clunky lines Ford v Ferrari throws our way, and trust me, they all hurt just about as much as that wrench Bale throws at Damon. Fortunately, they&#8217;re all made worth it by the exemplary racing sequences. Those make it absolutely worth it to have seen the film on the big screen. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s better than Rush in this regard &#8211; I&#8217;ll have to rewatch that film to see &#8211; but it&#8217;s bloody good all the same. Mangold accomplishes a great feat, in that he very effectively puts you in the car with Bale as he&#8217;s racing for his life, always inches away from death.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve seen Ford v Ferrari described as a &#8220;dad movie.&#8221; Yeah, that&#8217;s accurate. It&#8217;s certainly a throwback to the era they&#8217;ll remember. Josh Lucas plays a great &#8220;you&#8217;ll love to hate him&#8221; villain who comes to embody the corporate side of racing. Caitriona Balfe is great, but she&#8217;s also more or less just playing &#8220;the wife.&#8221; Noah Jupe&#8217;s also great, but he&#8217;s also just playing &#8220;the son.&#8221; And for a movie called Ford v Ferrari, there is basically no input from Ferrari beyond the opening and closing minutes. Still, it is entertaining, and, for all its pacing and scripting issues, very cinematic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"http:\/\/quinnews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/ford-v-ferrari-DF-01366_R_CC_CROP_rgbW-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2570\" srcset=\"http:\/\/quinnews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/ford-v-ferrari-DF-01366_R_CC_CROP_rgbW-1024x683.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/quinnews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/ford-v-ferrari-DF-01366_R_CC_CROP_rgbW-300x200.jpg 300w, http:\/\/quinnews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/ford-v-ferrari-DF-01366_R_CC_CROP_rgbW-768x512.jpg 768w, http:\/\/quinnews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/ford-v-ferrari-DF-01366_R_CC_CROP_rgbW-480x320.jpg 480w, http:\/\/quinnews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/ford-v-ferrari-DF-01366_R_CC_CROP_rgbW-750x500.jpg 750w, http:\/\/quinnews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/ford-v-ferrari-DF-01366_R_CC_CROP_rgbW.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Matt Damon and Christian Bale on the set of Twentieth Century Fox\u2019s FORD V FERRARI.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n",

            "rendered": "\n<p>Jojo Rabbit is a movie that will confuse some, annoy more, and anger most. It\u2019s an \u201canti-hate\u201d satire that\u2019s been accused by some of heinous bowdlerization; of being a \u201cHeartwarming Holocaust feel-good flick\u201d that ignores, or paves over, the atrocities of the time.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interestingly, though, I\u2019m not seeing that much in the way of controversy about this film. Sure, there were the expected \u201cOMG THIS IS THE MOST DANGEROUS FILM SINCE JOKER\u201d headlines from the increasingly desperate clickbait-based \u201cnews\u201d sites, but I guess those were non-starters, because there haven\u2019t been that many. If I had to guess, I\u2019d say <em>Jojo Rabbit<\/em> is too good-hearted and pure to really get that worked up over, in spite of its tricky material.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, that sentence might seem very strange to anyone who hasn\u2019t seen the movie. A good-hearted and pure movie\u2026about Nazis? Trust me, it works. I think that\u2019s partially because this isn\u2019t \u201creally\u201d about Nazis, or Nazism. The iconography is used, as well as some surface-level trappings, but really, it could be anything. What <em>Jojo Rabbit<\/em> is about is cliques. The Third Reich is portrayed as an elitist social club, and little Jojo is a lonely little kid who wants in with the big boys, to such an extent that he\u2019s blind to the club\u2019s rotten core.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, to many people, this will come across as wildly misguided. Writing it all out, I find myself amazed at what Taika Waititi has pulled off. From where I\u2019m sitting, <em>Jojo Rabbit<\/em> is a perfectly judged film, a balancing act that spends nearly two hours riiiiiight on the edge of dipping into monstrously poor taste, without ever crossing the line.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a couple of ways, what Taika Waititi has done here reminds me of a sillier Spike Lee film. It\u2019s thrillingly fearless, with a direct line to your emotional core. It has no need for such things like \u201csubtlety,\u201d nor should it. But whereas the films of Mr. Lee are usually vivaciously angry, Waititi is stubbornly feel-good, even in the face of unimaginable tragedy.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn\u2019t exactly smiles and sunshine always. There is darkness creeping around the edges of the film, occasionally taking stabs at its heart. Don\u2019t believe for a second that the horrors of living in Nazi Germany are glossed over, or made completely frivolous. This is a kind movie, but it\u2019s not a facetious one.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know how I\u2019d describe this movie? Cathartic. I needed to see this movie, in a way that I\u2019m still at a loss to explain. A special word must go to Roman Griffin Davis, making his acting debut as young Jojo. Think about that; this is his first movie. This is his first job, period. What he does in this movie is extraordinary. He took a character that could\u2019ve gone so wrong, and made him one of the most brilliant original characters of 2019. I found myself completely engaged with the movie because I was invested in the fate of Jojo\u2019s soul.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, this won&#8217;t work for everyone. This is a wavelength movie if ever there was one; you gotta get on board with what it\u2019s doing, or be completely lost at sea. I can imagine some out there will find themselves completely unsympathetic to Jojo\u2019s plight. I can imagine some out there will find what Waititi does here completely wrongheaded. I can also easily imagine some out there feeling comfortable denouncing this movie without bothering to see it (I have absolutely no sympathy for that last group there). Regardless, as someone who actually saw the damn film, I found myself treated to a resonant, fully-realized film, one that knew exactly what it was doing, and did it with a smile.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"http:\/\/quinnews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/jojo-rabbit.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2567\" srcset=\"http:\/\/quinnews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/jojo-rabbit.jpg 1000w, http:\/\/quinnews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/jojo-rabbit-300x169.jpg 300w, http:\/\/quinnews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/jojo-rabbit-768x432.jpg 768w, http:\/\/quinnews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/jojo-rabbit-480x270.jpg 480w, http:\/\/quinnews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/jojo-rabbit-888x500.jpg 888w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><figcaption>Taika Waititi and Roman Griffin Davis in the film JOJO RABBIT.

            "rendered": "\n<p>Man, the new movie by the guy who directed <em>Snowpiercer<\/em> is really picking up steam!<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2026get it? Picking up steam? Because it\u2019s from the same director who did <em>Snowpiercer<\/em>? The movie about the train that never stops? Get it?&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ah, never mind\u2026<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I had to guess, I\u2019d say that Parasite is a very different kind of movie than what most \u2018Murican audiences will be used to from Bong Joon-ho. While he\u2019s done drama before &#8211; <em>Barking Dogs Never Bite<\/em> and <em>Mother <\/em>&#8211; over here, his most popular films are his genre pieces. Films like <em>The Host, <\/em>his take on Godzilla, <em>Okja<\/em>, which is more fantasy than anything, or the aforementioned <em>Snowpiercer, <\/em>which is all about a magical train that goes around and around the world, forever and ever\u2026suffice it to say, I can easily imagine a scenario where someone goes into a movie called <em>Parasite<\/em>, knowing it\u2019s by the guy who made all those films, expecting another dip into sci-fi and horror, and getting what appears to be a straight-up drama instead. There are parasites in this movie\u2026but they\u2019re all very human.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Parasite<\/em> has to do with a downtrodden, out-of-work family of four. We see in the opening scene that they in such squalor that, when a fumigation crew starts dusting the street outside, they decide to leave the window open to get rid of their roach problem. For free! Things take an interesting turn, however, when a friend of Ki-woo &#8211; the son in the family &#8211; asks him to fill in as a tutor to the daughter of a rich family. Ki-woo obliges, but soon into his first day he senses an opening for his sister, Ki-jeong, to join him as an art tutor for the rich son. Never mind that she doesn\u2019t know the first thing about art, and doesn\u2019t have any credentials; nothing a bit of light forgery can\u2019t fix. Once she\u2019s there, though, she starts looking for positions for her parents. The other jobs around the household are already taken by other people, but if something were to happen to them\u2026<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Doesn\u2019t sound much like <em>Snowpiercer<\/em>, does it? But make no mistake; <em>Parasite<\/em> comes from the same mind. For one thing, despite all appearances, it\u2019s very fluid, genre-wise. It defies simple characterization, which I always like (I\u2019m generally of the opinion that genre restrictions are stupid). It begins as a satire, before hardening into straight drama, then back into comedy, before elements of horror start to creep in, and then\u2026I\u2019d better not say. But Bong Joon-ho is always in complete control; I never felt that he was just throwing whatever he wanted at the wall, and seeing what stuck. There was a purpose to the tonal shifts, and the end result was a film experience that I couldn\u2019t predict the end of, or even the next scene of.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the main clue that this is a Bong Joon-ho picture is the recurring theme of class warfare. I\u2019m bringing up <em>Snowpiercer<\/em> a lot in this review, and there\u2019s a reason for that, beyond the fact that I love it. <em>Snowpiercer <\/em>isn\u2019t just a movie about a train endlessly circling a desolate, frozen earth; it\u2019s a movie about the way the train divides its passengers into different cars based on their wealth and social status, and the eventual armed revolution by the have-nots against the haves.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Parasite<\/em> isn\u2019t as fantastical as <em>Snowpiercer<\/em>, or even <em>Okja, <\/em>but it absolutely deals with the same themes. Weirdly, Parasite serves as a kind of spiritual relative to Jordan Peele\u2019s <em>Us<\/em> from earlier this year. They\u2019re both comedy-drama-horror hybrids that start out as one thing, before slowly transitioning into a parable about the lengths the disenfranchised will go, not only to survive, but to get back what they think they\u2019re owed. There\u2019s something almost supernatural about the way the family systematically attaches themselves to the rich family; watching them at work, they almost could be seen as the tethered.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It works, though, for two main reasons. The first, it\u2019s never moralistic, or heavy-handed. The themes are right there, but you do have to work for them. The social satire of the movie mostly comes up through contrast; for instance, when there\u2019s a downpour about midway through the movie, the poor family (I refer to them as such because we never get any last names) has to worry about their little hovel flooding. The rich family, by contrast, spend the whole day post-flood commenting on how lovely their wet grass looks, which irritates the poor family to no end.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second reason is much simpler; it\u2019s just wildly entertaining. There are sequences so brilliantly put together, the audience I saw this with was simultaneously screaming and in stitches. This is a prime example of a film that deals with heady subjects dead on, while still maintaining a high entertainment value.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"http:\/\/quinnews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/hero_parasite-movie-review-2019-1024x427.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2564\" srcset=\"http:\/\/quinnews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/hero_parasite-movie-review-2019-1024x427.jpeg 1024w, http:\/\/quinnews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/hero_parasite-movie-review-2019-300x125.jpeg 300w, http:\/\/quinnews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/hero_parasite-movie-review-2019-768x320.jpeg 768w, http:\/\/quinnews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/hero_parasite-movie-review-2019-480x200.jpeg 480w, http:\/\/quinnews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/hero_parasite-movie-review-2019.jpeg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n",

            "rendered": "\n<p>Though the pendulum has been swinging for some time now, historical biopics about black women are rare. It must be said, though, that this one\u2019s been coming for a while now. The story of Harriet Tubman &#8211; probably the most legendary &#8220;conductor&#8221; on the Underground railroad &#8211; is one that practically screams out for the silver screen treatment. A woman born into slavery, Tubman &#8211; born Araminta \u201cMinty\u201d Ross &#8211; managed to escape her bondage, traveling over a hundred miles to Philidelphia, and then more or less immediately turned right around, heading back into enemy territory to liberate as many slaves as possible.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll say this; if you&#8217;re planning on seeing <em>Harriet<\/em> just to escape the recent deluge of comic book adaptations, save your money. <em>Harriet<\/em> goes out of its way to take this extraordinary, real-life hero, and strip her of every possible human frailty, until eventually turning her into a literal superhero.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first scene of the film begins this two-hour long lionization of Tubman. We see her as a young woman, still enslaved, in the throes of one of her &#8220;spells,\u201d a kind of trance-like state she frequently enters throughout the movie, one which apparently allows her to see memories from the past and visions of the future. Tubman, a deeply religious woman, is convinced that the spells are caused by divine intervention, and for all intents and purposes the film agrees with her. What else are we to make of the scene where, when escaping through the woods with most of her family in tow, she enters a trance, and then somehow intuits that the path they\u2019re on will lead them into a trap?<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The film continues in this fashion, never passing up an opportunity to raise Tubman up on the highest of pedestals. The obvious question here is, so what? What\u2019s the problem? If ever there was a historical figure that deserves lionization in the extreme, shouldn\u2019t it be Harriet Tubman?&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My issues with <em>Harriet<\/em> aren\u2019t so much that it plays up the heroic nature of her actions &#8211; a seemingly impossible task that the film somehow accomplishes anyway &#8211; but more that it systematically removes every single source of hardship from her life. Tubman never seems to encounter any real hardship, or at least any kind of hardship that poses any kind of an obstacle for her. The film pays lip service to the horrors of slavery, familial abandonment, and the perils of long travel, without immersing us in either. As such, it took what is to my mind a truly breathtaking real-life experience, and made it honestly pretty boring. Why should I care what happens to this woman when she\u2019s never presented as being in any danger at any point in time?<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a very poorly paced film. It\u2019s just over two hours long, but it still feels improbably rushed, almost like it\u2019s missing several reels. The editor, Wyatt Smiths, pieces Harriet together in a way that seems to actively thwart investment; we\u2019re never in any one location for long enough to get invested, either in the place or the characters that occupy it. As such, the world of <em>Harriet<\/em> never comes to life in a satisfying way. I\u2019ll say this; it never feels like a set, at least in terms of its visuals. Cinematographer John Toll has a knack for these kinds of sweeping visuals, having previously shot <em>The Last Samurai<\/em> and <em>The Thin Red Line<\/em>. The scene in which Harriet literally jumps over the Maryland state line to freedom, the sun shining down on her in a Heavenly aura, is appropriately awe-inspiring.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But while the thing looks grand, it never <em>feels <\/em>grand. All the pretty visuals in the world don\u2019t mean jack if you\u2019re not able to shoot them in an appropriately epic way. And it must be said that <em>Harriet<\/em> is directed in a way that feels unfortunately flat and uninspired. Cynthia Erivo is giving a good performance here, one that might have been a great performance if the film had just let it breathe a little before rushing off to the next thing.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s honestly my big takeaway from this film; a wealth of potential, wasted by the film\u2019s insistence on being as crushingly conventional as possible. There\u2019s a great life story here, one that absolutely deserves to be told on the big screen. But when you saddle the film with an uninspired script, a blandly repetitive score, and an almost pathological aversion to any actual tension, you end up wasting that potential.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"http:\/\/quinnews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/191024-harriet-biopic-2-ew-216p_de1e396922d2e7fb3bf83e468e09e6bb.fit-2000w-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2561\" srcset=\"http:\/\/quinnews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/191024-harriet-biopic-2-ew-216p_de1e396922d2e7fb3bf83e468e09e6bb.fit-2000w-1024x683.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/quinnews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/191024-harriet-biopic-2-ew-216p_de1e396922d2e7fb3bf83e468e09e6bb.fit-2000w-300x200.jpg 300w, http:\/\/quinnews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/191024-harriet-biopic-2-ew-216p_de1e396922d2e7fb3bf83e468e09e6bb.fit-2000w-768x512.jpg 768w, http:\/\/quinnews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/191024-harriet-biopic-2-ew-216p_de1e396922d2e7fb3bf83e468e09e6bb.fit-2000w-480x320.jpg 480w, http:\/\/quinnews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/191024-harriet-biopic-2-ew-216p_de1e396922d2e7fb3bf83e468e09e6bb.fit-2000w-750x500.jpg 750w, http:\/\/quinnews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/191024-harriet-biopic-2-ew-216p_de1e396922d2e7fb3bf83e468e09e6bb.fit-2000w.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n",

            "rendered": "\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s almost hard to believe that <em>The Shining <\/em>was only Stephen King\u2019s third book. He wrote it in the throes of alcoholism, in part as a way to purge his darkest demons. A horror story about an alcoholic writer who is trapped with his family in a snowed-in hotel, and slowly overtaken by the malicious forces within its halls, King has described the novel as a \u201cconfession\u201d of sorts, a way to come to terms with the real anger he occasionally felt towards his children. You can imagine his frustration, then, when Stanley Kubrick chose to jettison most of the alcoholic undertones &#8211; as well as damn near all the relatability of the alcoholic writer &#8211; in favor of making a more general parable about abuse.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>King fucking HATES the Kubrick <em>Shining, <\/em>to an almost legendary extent. He\u2019s made clear that he resents the fact that Kubrick took the main character, Jack Torrance &#8211; a twisted self-insert if ever there was one &#8211; and turned him from a flawed, but ultimately well-meaning family man into a psychotic murderer who seems perfectly willing and able to kill his whole family without any ghostly influence. Famously, he went so far as to commission an entire made-for-TV miniseries, just so that he could get the \u201ctrue\u201d version of his story onto a screen. This wasn\u2019t enough, though, and in 2013 he wrote a whole-ass sequel to his book, one which went out of its way to ignore all the changes Kubrick made to the story in favor of following up on the book\u2019s story threads.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I read <em>Doctor Sleep <\/em>pretty soon after it came out. It\u2019s\u2026not great, and I say this as a fan. King\u2019s prose is evocative as always, and there are moments of real power here and there (the segment at the beginning where we see grown-up Danny Torrance hitting rock-bottom is powerful for how personal it is). But the thing is dramatically structureless, a victim of King\u2019s late-career inability to plan his stories out properly. Sometimes, this never-plan-ahead strategy results in free-flowing brilliance. This was not one of those times. <em>Doctor Sleep<\/em> was a book full of things that just kind of happened, one after the other, until the end, at which point instead of climaxing they just sort of petered out.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I was dubious about the efficacy of a film adaptation of the novel, even before director Mike Flannigan revealed that he would be marrying his vision to Kubrick\u2019s; in effect, that he\u2019d be making a sequel to the book AND the film of <em>The Shining<\/em>. This was a dubious prospect at best, considering how many differences exist between the two. Even putting aside the more fundamental issue of Jack Torrance, there are a number of surface-level plot discrepancies that differentiate the adaptations; the book has hedge animals that come to life and try to kill you, the movie has a massive hedge maze. Kindly old cook Dick Halloran dies in the film adaptation, whereas he makes it in the book. And &#8211; and this is a pretty big one &#8211; the Overlook Hotel completely burns down in the climax of the novel, whereas the end of the movie sees it standing tall.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fact is, <em>The Shining<\/em> is not the type of film you make a sequel to. It\u2019s completely self-contained, as closed off from the outside world as the poor, doomed Torrance family. As directed by Kubrick, it\u2019s a largely plot-free nightmare of a film, concerned mainly with the frighteningly unique experience and atmosphere of the thing. <em>Doctor Sleep<\/em> takes the bare-bones iconography of the film &#8211; the twins, the tricycle, the elevator of blood &#8211; and staples it onto a plot. The results are about what you\u2019d expect.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is the plot? Well, I\u2019m sorry you asked. So, there\u2019s this group of Shining Vampires, see? They call themselves the True Knot, and they have the ability to sense if someone has the Shining within them or not. So what they do is, they kidnap that person, eat them, and suck the Shining out of them while moaning orgastically with glowing eyes. It is, somehow, even more ridiculous than I just made it sound. The True Knot were pathetic villains in the book, and they\u2019ve somehow been made even more cartoonish here.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>See, as I always saw it, the Shining was kind of an allegorical thing. The beauty of the Kubrick movie was that it existed between the precipice of madness and supernatural; you were never sure of where you were, or what was really happening. It operated on pure nightmare logic. Here, not only is the Shining a tangible thing, but it\u2019s represented via CGI smoke that comes out of people\u2019s mouths. I\u2019m serious.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s not just that this film doesn\u2019t capture the elusive, intangible fear of the film, or the more overtly allegorical and emotional &#8211; but no less effective &#8211; fear of the book. Doctor Sleep doesn\u2019t capture any fear, ever. This isn\u2019t a scary movie. The one time it comes close is this extended, gratuitious murder scene involving a small child. It goes on for too long, and feels genuinely exploitative. The fact is, the Kubrick film was too classy to sink to this.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even in its attempts to be a more conventional film, I thought it failed. I\u2019ve already mentioned that the True Knot are a gaggle of absolute laughingstocks, but Abra Stone doesn\u2019t fare much better. I remember liking this character back when I read the book; being able to see a character\u2019s internal dialogue really does wonders for making them interesting. Here, she\u2019s a nothing of a character, the latest in a long, long, <em>long<\/em> line of stock \u201ckid with psychic powers\u201d that King loves to write. Maybe Kyliegh Curran has it in her to be a great actress &#8211; in fairness to her, no one other than Ewan McGreggor really fares well in this &#8211; but as it stands, there are a ton of scenes where her character could be replaced by a cardboard cutout for all the difference it would make.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What sucks especially is that there are a handful of moments that hint at a really good idea at the heart of this film. Like I said, McGreggor is great in this; it\u2019s through his acting that we come the closest to understanding what it would actually be like to live in the aftermath of a very specific trauma. And while so much of this film\u2019s finale consists of, \u201cHey, remember this?\u201d there is one scene &#8211; a conversation at a bar &#8211; that raises a number of fascinating possibilities. But it\u2019s not enough. As a film that tries to exist at the intersection between two versions of <em>The Shining, Doctor Sleep<\/em> ends up honoring neither.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"http:\/\/quinnews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/doctor-sleep-traielr2-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2575\" srcset=\"http:\/\/quinnews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/doctor-sleep-traielr2-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/quinnews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/doctor-sleep-traielr2-300x169.jpg 300w, http:\/\/quinnews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/doctor-sleep-traielr2-768x432.jpg 768w, http:\/\/quinnews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/doctor-sleep-traielr2-480x270.jpg 480w, http:\/\/quinnews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/doctor-sleep-traielr2-889x500.jpg 889w, http:\/\/quinnews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/doctor-sleep-traielr2.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n",

            "rendered": "\n<p>Dear\nPresident Kent Devereaux, <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am\nwriting to express my deepest concerns about the decision to lay off ACE staff\nmembers Peejo Sehr and Kay Beard. I am aware that the outcry about the staff\ncuts has not gone unnoticed, however the attempts by the administration to\naddress student, alumni, parent, and faculty concerns have yet to even\nacknowledged the problem, let alone offer a suitable solution. The reason that\nthe Goucher community is outraged at Peejo and Kay\u2019s departure from the staff\nis not for fear that the Academic Center for Excellence as a support service\nwill cease to exist, but rather that there cannot and will not be an Academic\nCenter for Excellence that offers the same level of care and support to\nstudents without Peejo Sehr and Kay Beard. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Student support is essential on a college campus. College is often the first time a student is away from home for extended periods of time, and there is an abrupt change in a student\u2019s academic and social life that can leave students feeling lost and alone. I can only speak from my experience, but my freshman year was incredibly difficult. I chose Goucher because of the tight-knit community that was advertised to me, but when I arrived, I realized that the whole admissions spiel was nothing more than a fa\u00e7ade. In reality, the community is broken; bits and pieces can be found intact, but mostly the community can only be found in tiny nooks and crannies, each group hiding from the other to avoid communication lest it turn to confrontation. Yet, the school carries on, trying to forget our abysmal retention rate that causes even more fractures within the community. Being confronted with this reality as a first year was incredibly difficult, and I honestly felt like I had very few people who would listen to my struggle with college life until I found ACE. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I walked into my first appointment with Peejo Sehr, I knew that I had found home. She was the first person at this school who truly listened to me, who saw me as an equal, and who wanted more than anything for me to succeed. Because of Peejo I found my voice, my community, and my own identity here at Goucher. The reason I am telling this story is not to be anecdotal, but rather to give a specific example of how ACE was instrumental in my decision to stay at Goucher after a very hard transition to college. I have talked to countless other students who have similar stories of feeling that ACE is their home and that the women who run it are their family. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kay and Peejo have fought to support students holistically, by supporting them as individuals instead of as names on a page. Peejo\u2019s meditation workshops have given students a way to destress and become healthier, happier people. Kay\u2019s coordination of the Supplemental Instructors has helped raise student\u2019s grades and give them more confidence in their classes. It is impossible to put a price tag on their contributions to the Goucher community, and the fact that their very positions were deemed as unnecessary to the school is the greatest of all insults. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The administration may have the power to make the decision to remove Kay Beard and Peejo Sehr from the staff, but they will pay the price if they do not reverse their decision. I can already predict what will happen. First and foremost, ACE will not be able to continue to provide the same holistic academic support that it previously offered, as Peejo and Kay were driving forces behind the push to mentor students in a way that would not just focus on grades, but also the health and wellbeing of the students. Because of this, students will not receive the same individualized support and attention, leading to more students feeling alone and frustrated at Goucher and making the decision to transfer. Not only will Goucher lose current students, but they will lose prospective students, as ACE as it is today (including Lucy, Peejo\u2019s dog, who has been a support animal for many students at Goucher) is a major selling point of the school. Students&#8217; grades will also drop, as there will not be enough trained Academic Coaches at ACE to support the number of students who come seeking academic support. It is not yet clear how the SI program will continue without Kay\u2019s dedicated work, which yet is another reason why the academic rigor of the school will suffer. But above all, ACE will never be the home that it used to be to so many students and those students will remember the people who made the decision to take away their support network. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\nunderstand that Goucher needs to make budget cuts in order to continue to\noperate, however I find it utterly perplexing as to how the administration\ncould have determined that making cuts to ACE staff would assist in that\nendeavor. It is possible that for the time being having to pay two less\nsalaries will save the school money, but if Goucher is thinking more long term,\nas it should, the results of this decision can only be negative. Furthermore, I\nvery much doubt that any student on this campus would say that ACE resources\nare a waste of the college\u2019s money and the fact that we, as a student body,\nwere not consulted about our opinion on the value of the different\nadministrative services is insulting. We, the students, are supposed to be the\nmost important factor in this equation, yet it appears to me more and more that\nwe do not matter, that we do not have a voice, and that we are the last people\nthe administration cares about. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sincerely,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma\nKristjanson-Gural<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Class of \u201822<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Editor&#8217;s Note: To submit a letter or other form of opinion piece the to <em>The Quindecim<\/em>, please email quin@mail.goucher.edu.<\/p>\n",

Apple.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">In June of 2019, Apple hosted their annual conference, the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), to discuss and reveal the updates coming to all of their products this fall. Among these update announcements, Apple announced the next major iteration of their desktop operating system on Mac computers, macOS. This fifteenth major update, macOS Catalina, brings many improvements and changes to the platform such as an automatic dark mode and the removal of iTunes in favor of separate Music, Podcasts, and TV apps. This update arrived to the public in October, and reception of this update has been mixed. While this new update brings better security and refinements to what Mojave, the previous update, brought, a lot has been changed to where some older apps won&#8217;t work anymore and where developers have to jump through hoops to keep their software running on macOS. However, I don&#8217;t think this necessarily warrants throwing this release into the trash and rioting against Apple. Despite dropping support for 32bit software, requiring notarization on all apps, apps ported to the Mac from iOS being a mixed bag, and overall instabilities with the platform, after testing the update since June, macOS Catalina is still a great improvement and shouldn&#8217;t be held to the bad reputation it has received.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Goodbye, 32bit<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the major changes Apple announced with this release of macOS is the removal of 32bit support in favor of 64bit. Computers with 64bit processors and software are more capable of doing things compared to computers with 32bit processors; most modern computers and platforms are already 64bit. Apple announced their first 64bit version of macOS back in 2009 with OS X Snow Leopard. However, there are some old apps and games written for the older 32bit such as Office 2011 and Portal 2. You wouldn&#8217;t be able to run these under macOS Catalina; you&#8217;d have to buy new software or hope that the developer releases an update to the software.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it is a shame to see 32bit apps no longer work on macOS, it makes sense to keep going forward with 64bit. Apple can continue working on making refinements and updates to macOS and make the installation size smaller. A lot of apps have been written for 64bit and are already taking advantage of what it has to offer. While 32bit has been around for a while, it&#8217;s too old to keep supporting in this day and age. As Rene Ritchie from the Vector podcast states in his macOS Catalina review, &#8220;more than a decade of writing-on-the-wall later, 32-bit apps deserve to die.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Malware-Free, Notarized Apps<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Last year with macOS Mojave, Apple introduced a new process called <em>notarization<\/em> to ensure that apps don&#8217;t contain malware in them by letting developers send their app to Apple to be checked by an automated system. According to Apple at their presentation about notarization at this year&#8217;s WWDC, notarization became widely adopted since its introduction and most apps get notarized within 15 minutes from their upload time. Now, starting with macOS Catalina, Apple is making notarization a requirement for all future apps built after June 1, 2019. Since this announcement, the company&#8217;s received flak from the developer community since these apps need to be signed before they can be notarized, meaning that developers have to pay Apple $99 yearly to get access through its developer program. Additionally, for developers that are enrolled in the developer program, they might run into more issues if they aren&#8217;t using Apple&#8217;s development tool Xcode, getting the app notarized can be tricky. On top of that, notarization becomes impossible if Apple&#8217;s notarization servers are down, putting app updates in limbo. While Apple, as of September, has relaxed the notarization requirements until January 2020, the existing issues remain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some developers see this move to required notarization as a tactic Apple is using to tighten macOS and force sales through the Mac App Store, though this doesn&#8217;t really make sense, especially for a desktop operating system where the platform is open in the sense that its users can download apps from anywhere and run them without going to an arbitrary software center. Although the notarization process can get annoying and add additional steps to releasing apps for macOS without going through the Mac App Store, I don&#8217;t necessarily see notarization in a bad light. Notarization lets users know that the software they&#8217;re downloading is secured by the developer and won&#8217;t completely wreck their system. It is true that notarization has its flaws: the servers were unresponsive the past few days, so apps like Hyperspace and Slack couldn&#8217;t notarize their latest update, and developers still have to pay Apple to get this notarization. However, I&#8217;m sure these flaws will be ironed out as notarization works to become the standard process. Even then, apps that aren&#8217;t notarized will still run; you&#8217;ll just need to take an extra step to open it the first time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>A Volatile Catalyst<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/dAgGGjafd7EYrXtuee_MqCCKP-nV8qchxetHFdfqNr3WZHLHAVOgp9BpwA9gFM3mEaGTJqbc135Z0vzse0B6O-s6Kn04WCVqJhprkg_34DA2V9j82HJPHY8Zt02HRbLzydxeillM\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The Twitter app on iPad and macOS Catalina<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>macOS Catalina also brings some new technologies that make it possible to port apps from iOS to the Mac with Xcode. This technology, now called Mac Catalyst, has existed and been tested for a while; the News, Stocks, Voice Memos, and Home apps from macOS Mojave use Mac Catalyst. While Catalyst seems to open doors in terms of more apps coming to the Mac from iOS, it isn&#8217;t without its issues. Developers have found that they needed to tweak their app a lot more. James Thompson, developer of the iOS calculator app PCalc, describes his process and frustration about porting the app Dice to the Mac using Catalyst on his blog:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Once you get past that first check box, and want to build out Mac-specific features like menus, the&nbsp;APIs start to feel rougher and unfinished. [&#8230;] I am hopeful that this is just a 1.0 [&#8230;] and things will&nbsp;continue to improve. It\u2019s a great foundation, but there\u2019s still a way to go before I could use it for&nbsp;PCalc&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Developer frustration aside, the quality of the current selection of apps ported from iOS on the Mac App Store is mixed. While Twitter seems to perform fine, it definitely doesn&#8217;t feel as in-place as other Mac apps. Atlassian&#8217;s issue tracker software Jira Cloud feels more integrated, but the performance is not the best and seems to hang when performing simple tasks like undoing an issue update from the clipboard. Yet Apple&#8217;s own apps like News, Podcasts, and Voice Memos perform just about as well as you can expect. In addition to this, both Jira and Twitter have different interface designs on Apple&#8217;s developer website than what is currently being distributed, indicating that the technology might not give them the ability to design their apps as advertised or Mac Catalyst overall seems half-baked, and we can only hope that this will improve over time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>In Defense of macOS Catalina<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the quirks of macOS Catalina regarding the removal of 32bit support, required notarization, and the mess that is Mac Catalyst, this update remains a solid release. The new auto dark mode feature is decent, and the new apps replacing iTunes feel great for regular use. The new accessibility features also complement macOS nicely, letting anyone control their Mac with their voice. As always, macOS updates also contain many bug fixes and security patches to improve performance, reliability, and security.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>In conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, it definitely seems that the downsides of macOS Catalina have been blown out of proportion. 32bit-support is gone, but we&#8217;ve been in an era of 64bit computing for a while now. We&#8217;re entering an era of more security and assurance of software quality through notarization, even if there&#8217;s some costs associated with it. Though Catalyst is more of an experiment right now than anything, it&#8217;s paving the future of truly cross-platform apps that adapt to different computing models. While the first release of Catalina hasn&#8217;t been what everyone was expecting, we can only get better from here and refine it until Apple surprises us again with the next macOS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n",
